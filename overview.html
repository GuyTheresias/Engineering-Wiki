                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <hr style="color: #876a57;">
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Electrical engineering was said to have emerged as a
                    discipline in 1864, when James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physician summarized the basic laws of
                    electricity in mathematical form and showed that radiation of electromagnetic energy travels through
                    space at the speed of light. Maxwell then began to theorize ways to artificially recreate the
                    discovered electromagnetic energies. Eventually a German physician named Heinrich Hertz in 1887
                    successfully created this phenomenon via radio waves.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These scientific studies, combined with the industrial
                    innovations of the telephone by Alexander Grahm Bell and Thomas Edison’s innovations such as the
                    lightbulb and power plant combined to form the intellectual and practical groundwork for the
                    electrical engineer. Knowledge on electrical theories and how to practically apply them for
                    industrial use would become increasingly useful as nations built and expanded sophisticated power
                    grids, and companies began to produce electronic appliances.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Edison grew up in the American Midwest, primarily Port
                    Huron Michigan. Although he was not born there, the place of his birth was instead Milan Ohio in
                    1847. He was very interested in technology from a young age and as a young man he worked as a
                    telegraph operator, familiarizing himself with the technology. Impoverished and living in a man’s
                    basement in Elizibeth New jersey, Thomas Edison continued worked on the multiplex telegraphic
                    system. This device would be his first financial success, allowing for two users to send messages
                    simultaneously. He then produced the phonograph, an audio recording device that earned him
                    widespread recognition for its novelty and ingenuity. What he is most known for today was the
                    creation of the lightbulb. While he was not the first to ever attempt such a concept, his was by far
                    the most effective, and so his breakthrough allowed electric light to be shined across the world.

                    William Shockley
                </h5>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Born in London in 1910, William Shockley was raised by
                    American parents in Palto Alto, California. He was homeschooled until eight years of age and learnt
                    physics from his next-door neighbor who was a Stanford physics professor. He achieved his Bachelor
                    of Science degree from Caltech in 1932 and a PhD from MIT in 1936. Shortly after, he became the
                    director of research at Bell Labs later in the same year. He worked to find alternatives to vacuum
                    tubes when his work was interrupted by the Second World War, and he was enlisted to help the US
                    government on a various series of wartime projects. These included, anti-submarine warfare research,
                    radar bomb sights for bomber aircraft, and casualty estimates for an invasion of the Japanese
                    mainland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the war Bell Labs formed a solid states physics
                    group led by Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan to finally put an end to the reign of feeble vacuum
                    tube amplifiers. In the winter of 1946, after much trial and error, the transistor had been
                    developed. The device being capable of regulating and amplifying electrical flow in a much more
                    efficient and compact manner than the vacuum tubes could ever achieve.

                    Robert Noyce
                </h5>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Born on December 12, 1927, in Burlington, Iowa, Noyce had
                    a spark of curiosity from a young age. He and his brother made a glider in the summer of 1940 which
                    they used to fly from the top of the Grinnell College stables. On more ridiculous happenstance was
                    when he mechanized his sled by welding a propeller and an old washing machine motor to it. While
                    quite dangerous, I can see such a mechanized monstrosity being very entertaining and incredibly fun.
                    Noyce would attend Grinnell College in 1945 and in his junior year he almost got imprisoned for
                    stealing the pig of the mayor and roasting it at the school’s Luau. He instead was suspended for
                    just one semester and sentenced to compensate the mayor. The only reason he was let off so lightly
                    was due to his great academic abilities, as the college felt it would be a tragedy to lose a bright
                    mind to such shenanigans. He would go on top get a doctorate in physics from MIT in 1953.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went on to be recruited by William Shockley in 1956,
                    but
                    within a year he and many others became
                    very jaded with Shockley’s authoritarian management styles. Eventually banding with a squad of
                    traitors known fittingly as “The Traitorous Eight”. These renegades left Shockley Semiconductor to
                    its fate and started the Fairchild Semiconductor corporation. Within this corporation Jack Kilby
                    invented the first hybrid integrated circuit. Noyce would then go on to perfect the concept with the
                    invention of his Monolithic Integrated Circuit, which could be massed produced unlike Kilby’s design
                    due to the components being contained within the circuit.
