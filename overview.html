                </h3>
                <hr style="color: #876a57;">
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Electrical engineering was said to have emerged as a
                    discipline in 1864, when James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physician summarized the basic laws of
                    electricity in mathematical form and showed that radiation of electromagnetic energy travels through
                    space at the speed of light. Maxwell then began to theorize ways to artificially recreate the
                    discovered electromagnetic energies. Eventually a German physician named Heinrich Hertz in 1887
                    successfully created this phenomenon via radio waves.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These scientific studies, combined with the industrial
                    innovations of the telephone by Alexander Grahm Bell and Thomas Edison’s innovations such as the
                    lightbulb and power plant combined to form the intellectual and practical groundwork for the
                    electrical engineer. Knowledge on electrical theories and how to practically apply them for
                    industrial use would become increasingly useful as nations built and expanded sophisticated power
                    grids, and companies began to produce electronic appliances.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Edison grew up in the American Midwest, primarily Port Huron Michigan. Although he was not born there, the place of his birth was instead Milan Ohio in 1847. He was very interested in technology from a young age and as a young man he worked as a telegraph operator, familiarizing himself with the technology. Impoverished and living in a man’s basement in Elizibeth New jersey, Thomas Edison continued worked on the multiplex telegraphic system. This device would be his first financial success, allowing for two users to send messages simultaneously. He then produced the phonograph, an audio recording device that earned him widespread recognition for its novelty and ingenuity. What he is most known for today was the creation of the lightbulb. While he was not the first to ever attempt such a concept, his was by far the most effective, and so his breakthrough allowed electric light to be shined across the world.
