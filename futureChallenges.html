                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The future for electrical engineering jobs is looking very
                    bright, from 2021 to 2031 there is
                    predicted to be a 6% growth in the career. With people retiring, passing away, or new jobs opening
                    up each year, there are predicted to be around 21,100 job openings. With the development of many new
                    technologies such as electric cars, AI, smart grids, and more, electrical engineers are becoming
                    more needed (UC Riverside).

                    certain areas water, food, land, and even air. This is especially prevalent in third-world
                    countries, especially in the case of water and food. As a result of the depleted resources,
                    deforestation has been on the rise for the production of these resources and energy.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Air pollution has also been a prevalent issue, this can be
                    caused by certain fuels for energy, factories, and inefficient fuel usage. The energy will be
                    discussed in the next section, but electrical engineering has been working efficiently to improve
                    this issue, as well as fuel usage in cars, electrical engineers work on electrical vehicles. Air
                    pollution can have many effects, such as poor air quality and acid rain. Through the efforts of
                    many, including electrical engineers, air pollution has been improving, but there still is a way to
                    go. This will be discussed later on in the energy section, but electrical engineers are working on
                    finding less harmful sources of energy. This will be one of the biggest challenges for these
                    engineers in the future.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Water pollution is also a large issue, there are many
                    causes such as wastewater, chemicals, sewage, acid rain, pesticides, and many more. 40% of the
                    worldâ€™s population already faces water shortages. Electrical engineering can be used to help create
                    water treatment technologies, working with other types of engineering. In the future, this
                    technology will only work to become more advanced. They have actually been using electricity to
                    clean water. By discharging the electricity into the water, it can turn the contaminants in the
                    water into minerals or gas. This is one of the ways that electrical engineers are treating water
                    pollution.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Energy is one of the most prevalent things involving the
                    future of electrical engineering. The consumption of energy is predicted to increase by 53% from
                    2008 to 2035. With this, renewable energy has become more popular. The United States wishes to be
                    less dependent on other countries for energy and in 2012 the international dependence on energy was
                    down 20% by 2035 the U.S. is predicted to be fuel efficient. Electrical engineers are needed for
                    this process. Electrical engineers are working with fuel efficiency and developing new types of
                    renewable energy. Unlike coal, oil, and natural gasses, renewable energy is well renewable,
                    nonrenewable energy sources will run out eventually. According to the book, renewable energy and
                    fuel are the fastest-growing energy sources. Not only this, but renewable energy is much cleaner for
                    the environment., With this, electrical engineers will work to help develop these types of energies.
                    Such as solar, wind, hydro, and more. Electrical engineers play crucial roles when it comes to
                    designing these forms of energy. Such as wind turbines, with the electrical engineers having to
                    figure out how to harness the energy from the wind turbine and turn it into electricity.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wasted fuel from traffic has cost $121 billion. Electrical
                    engineers have been given the difficult challenge of creating more fuel-efficient cars and
                    transportation. This will help lower the wasted fuel. The main challenge for engineers is keeping up
                    with the growing infrastructures and populations in the city to make sure everything runs smoothly,
                    this is for all types of engineers. There are hundreds of millions of vehicles on the roads, and
                    electrical engineers work on the efficiency of these up-and-coming vehicles to maximize efficiency
                    and minimize waste.

                    passed and gave 1.2 trillion dollars to help improve infrastructure. For the electrical engineers
                    this includes fixing challenges like transportation, electrical generation, transportation, the
                    internet, and many more.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Due to the increase of terrorism and conflict in the
                    Middle East, the United States has increased their defense. With this, the creation of weapons made
                    the need for weapons engineers. This type of engineering is a mix of a few types of engineering, one
                    of those being electrical engineering (everageedu.com). As conflicts only continue the rise, so will
                    the need for weapons. Future engineers will have to continue to develop weapons and this becomes a
                    large problem for them to overcome and create.

                    well. With climate disasters being so disastrous, Electrical engineers will only help develop these
                    in the future. This is especially relevant with the rise in global temperatures and the risk that
                    global warming presents to not only nature, but humans as well.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Competitiveness across the globe., The bachelor's degrees
                    have increased in the United States, but this is the case for all countries. So a large issue
                    covering all engineering fields is the United States' decline. From 1992 to 2012 the work is said to
                    have declined by 10%. In 2012-2013, the World Economic Forum covered some strengths and weaknesses
                    of the United States' global competitiveness. Some strengths are sophisticated companies, good
                    higher education, the largest domestic economy, and more. The issues come with weaknesses such as
                    turbulent government impacts on the business community, concern with the functioning of private
                    institutions, financial market capabilities, economic imbalances, and so on. This is a very swift
                    summary, but if the economy could be better, this creates struggles for engineers just trying to do
                    their job. It can make it difficult to get a good job, get good pay, and not to mention that many
                    engineers, especially electrical engineers, work for the government. If there is a government
                    shutdown, then they just won't get paid.

                    grand challenges, these are the ones that most pertain to electrical engineering. With electrical
                    engineering being so involved in renewable energy, solar energy being affordable greatly hands on
                    the shoulders of electrical engineers, this goes for energy from nuclear fusion as well. Again,
                    anything that pertains to electricity comes from electrical engineering, and that includes virtual
                    reality. Electrical engineering plays a key role in weapons engineering, so when it comes to
                    preventing nuclear terror it plays a large role. All engineers apply for the final challenge of
                    engineering tools for scientific discovery, constantly acquiring new knowledge is a must.
