                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Engineering is defined by ABET as: The profession in which
                    a knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences gained by study, experience, and practice is
                    applied with judgment to develop ways to utilize economically, the materials and forces of nature
                    for the benefit of mankind. Everything we see before us in the modern age has been to some degree
                    engineered. Our homes, our cars, the roads and sidewalks, the water pipes, electric cables beneath
                    our feet, and even radio signals shooting through the air. Such commodities a couple hundred years
                    ago would seem like science fiction, and today they have become the norm. We owe this to the
                    intellectual pursuits of engineers and the many fields of study they inhabit.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before there were the modern commodities and the boon of the
                    industrial ages, mankind was left bare against the elements. To protect the tribe and ensure their
                    survival, innovation was crucial. Clothes were fashioned by animal hides and primitive housing was
                    constructed for shelter against the elements. The men created weapons and tools so they could hunt and
                    bring home more resources for their tribe to flourish, and crude wooden vessels allowed humanity to
                    spread steadily across the width of the planet. While these developments happened before the term
                    “engineering” was birthed, they were the humble beginnings of our tremendous ability to shape the world
                    around us.

                    Early Cities and architectural innovations
                </h3>
                <hr style="color: #876a57;">
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As humanity reached higher levels of knowledge in agriculture
                    and animal husbandry, they began to settle down and establish themselves into cultural collectives.
                    These we know today as the city. Jobs began to specialize, as it was no longer required for all the men
                    to hunt for resources to sustain the tribe. More advanced tools were being made by the blacksmiths,
                    forged from metal. Such as plows for farming, swords, axes, and many others. In Egypt, during around
                    2700 BC, the Egyptians set out to build the great pyramids, a logistical and engineering marvel for
                    their time. With only rudimentary tools and pulleys, the Egyptians managed to build the pyramids over
                    400 feet tall made from massive stone blocks. Not only did they accomplish this task, but they still
                    stand to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Europe, the Greeks constructed another marvel, the
                    Parthenon in 447 BC. It required extreme precision, as it was to honor their own gods with a temple of
                    exquisite beauty. It was constructed of purely marble and was supported by finely partitioned marble
                    columns that supported the weight of the building’s roof. This great structure like the pyramids, still
                    stand to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As time ground on and cities grew larger and larger, so did
                    their needs. The Romans, for example, needed methods to transport goods and resources across their vast
                    empire. This need made the Romans great logisticians and transportation engineers. They constructed
                    roads leading throughout their territories, so supplies and soldiers could move swiftly within Roman
                    territories. Until 200 A.D when the Romans successfully connected every single one of their population
                    centers with a road. The Romans also connected the cities to freshwater resources via aqueducts, which
                    channeled water from a source directly into a Roman citizen’s home.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When The Industrial Revolution began in the 1800’s, the
                    world immediately changed. With machines being produced that greatly increased the pace in which
                    resources could be gathered, refined, and reconstructed into new products. However, the industrial
                    era created an entire new field of expertise that we know as industrial engineering. They optimize
                    production, transportation, material usage, manpower, and much more. Essentially, it is their job to
                    keep the complex systems of production running.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The computer allowed unparalleled advancement in
                    technology. The earliest computers were bulky and took up entire rooms. One man, Bernard M. Gordon
                    saw the potential in computers and set to work innovating upon the design. Eventually he created the
                    first commercial computer called UNIVAC and the first analog to digital converter. His innovations
                    set forth the powerful devices we now see permeating our entire lives. With Money, entertainment,
                    information, design, communication, and uncountable other concepts being digitalized.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, the engineering field continues to grow, as people
                    across the globe strive to innovate upon concepts and design new ones. From the early beginnings of
                    civil and agricultural engineering to aerospace, the depth of knowledge in engineering will only
                    grow larger.
