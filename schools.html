                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	Florida Polytechnic University is a public university located in Lakeland, FL. The school has a total of 1,531 undergraduate students. Tuition and fees average around $4,940, and room and board costs another $12,219 per year. After financial aid, the total cost of attendance averages out to around $8,895 a year. Florida Poly has an 18:1 student-to-faculty ratio and a 31% 4-year graduation rate. It is important to note, however, that Florida Poly primarily has engineering majors enrolled there. It is typical for engineering students to graduate in 5-6 years, even without failing any classes, just because of the higher course load. Florida Poly is a somewhat selective school in its admissions process, with a 47% acceptance rate. The middle 50 percent of accepted students have a 1230-1390 SAT, a 26-31 ACT, and a 3.5 GPA (“Florida Polytechnic University - profile, rankings and data”). Since Florida Polytechnic is so new, with it only having been around since 2012, there is limited data on electrical engineering student outcomes (“Undergraduate & Graduate Stem Degrees”).

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Florida Institute of Technology is a private university located in Melbourne, FL. The school has a total of 3,374 undergraduate students. Tuition and fees average around $44,360, and room and board costs another $14,340 per year. After financial aid, the total cost of attendance averages out to around $31,172 a year. Florida Tech has a 14:1 student-to-faculty ratio and a 50% 4-year graduation rate. The most popular majors at this school are also engineering, so this is an impressive graduation rate. Florida Tech is a somewhat selective school in its admissions process, with a 50% acceptance rate. The middle 50 percent of accepted students have an 1120-1320 SAT, a 22-28 ACT, and a 3.5 GPA (“Florida Institute of Technology - profile, rankings and data ”). While the tuition is much more expensive, one of the benefits of going to Florida Tech over a public school is the newer lab facilities. It is also mentioned that those with a bachelor’s degree in EE from Florida Tech have gone to graduate school at prestigious universities like Stanford and Georgia Tech (“Florida Tech”).

FSU has a 17:1 student-to-faculty ratio, which is similarly impressive to UF’s, and has the highest 4-year graduation rate in FL at 74%. FSU is a very selective school in its admissions process, with a 25% acceptance rate. The middle 50 percent of accepted students have a 1210-1370 SAT, a 26-31 ACT, and a 3.7 GPA (“Florida State University - profile, rankings and data”). Florida State University has the highest credit rating of any public university in Florida (“Florida State University”). It is also one of the only schools on this list where engineering isn’t one of the most popular majors (“Florida State University - profile, rankings and data”), which can be seen as a good thing because it makes acceptance into the program less competitive.
